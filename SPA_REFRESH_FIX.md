# SPA Refresh Issue Fix

## Problem
When users refresh the page on client-side routes (like `/about`, `/schools`, etc.), they get a 500 Internal Server Error because the Django server doesn't know how to handle these routes.

## Solution
I've implemented a **catch-all fallback route** in Django that serves the React app's `index.html` for any non-API routes, allowing client-side routing to work properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`backend/smru/urls.py`)
- Added a `spa_fallback` view that serves the built React app
- Added a catch-all pattern `<path:path>` that routes all non-API requests to the SPA
- Added proper static file serving for development

### 2. Backend Settings (`backend/smru/settings.py`)
- Added `STATIC_ROOT` configuration for proper static file handling

### 3. Frontend Build Config (`frontend/my-app/vite.config.js`)
- Enhanced build configuration for better production output
- Added proper asset handling

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Build Script (Recommended)
```bash
python build_and_test.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

1. **Build the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/my-app
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Testing the Fix

1. Start your Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
3. Navigate to any route like `/about`, `/schools`, `/contact`
4. **Refresh the page** - it should now work without errors!
5. Test all your routes to ensure they work on refresh

## How It Works

1. **API Routes** (like `/api/`, `/admin/`) are handled normally by Django
2. **SPA Routes** (like `/about`, `/schools`) are caught by the fallback pattern
3. The fallback serves the React app's `index.html`
4. React Router takes over and renders the correct component
5. **Result**: Refresh works on all routes! ðŸŽ‰

## Development vs Production

- **Development**: Use `npm run dev` for the frontend (runs on port 5500)
- **Production**: Build the frontend with `npm run build` and serve through Django

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Make sure the frontend is built:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/my-app
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Check that `dist/index.html` exists:**
   ```bash
   ls frontend/my-app/dist/
   ```

3. **Restart the Django server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. **Check Django logs** for any error messages

## Benefits

âœ… **No more 500 errors on refresh**  
âœ… **All client-side routes work properly**  
âœ… **SEO-friendly URLs**  
âœ… **Proper browser history support**  
âœ… **No breaking changes to existing functionality**  

The fix is backward compatible and doesn't break any existing features!
